<p>by Joseph Rickert</p>
<p>What are you reading? – and what are you recommending to friends, colleagues, and students who want to learn something about R programming? A quick search of Amazon will show that there are several new R books proposed for 2016; but of course, new doesn't necessarily mean better. I fully expect that many new books in all areas of statistics, data science and many other scientific disciplines using R to provide a computational aspect for their exposition will continue to be written for years to come. All of these books will provide windows into learning R for people excited about the particular subject matter. However, so many excellent R based texts have already been published that it will be difficult for these new works to achieve "must buy" status for the R content alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are my recommendations for good R reads. Some of these books go back a few years, but they continue to hold their value. With the possible exception of books that were based primarily on the S language, good R books don't become obsolete. Unlike some other computer languages, R evolves mostly through new capabilities added by contributed packages, not through changes to the R core. The fact that the d<a href="https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/package/dplyr/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/package/dplyr/', 'plyr']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank">plyr</a> family of packages may make data wrangling more convenient in many circumstances doesn't make a book that teaches data manipulation through base R functions any less relevant. In fact, some might argue that new students should be taught the basic functionally first. I am not a militant traditionalist, but it does seem to me that familiarity with the bare bones basics of the language will help newcomers to gain intuition about how R works.</p>
<p>There are three lists below. The first lists my picks for teaching R programming. (Top row in the graphic) The second list provides my recommendations for people interested in learning R for data science. (Second row in the graphic).</p>

<p>The third list is of books on my shelf that I continue to value. For every entry in all three lists I provide a mini or micro review. In a few cases, I point to a more extensive review that I have previously published in this blog. My lists are in no way intended to be complete. But, I apologize right now if I have omitted some really good books. Please let me know about what I have missed by commenting to this post with a mini review of your own.</p>
<h3>Learning R</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Advanced-R/Wickham/9781466586963" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.crcpress.com/Advanced-R/Wickham/9781466586963', 'Advanced R']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank" style="cursor: url(chrome-extension://ledmjlnkdlappilhaaihfhanlpdjjalm/rockhand.png), auto;">Advanced R</a> by Hadley Wickham – Anyone who wants to gain a deep understanding of the R language will certainly benefit from this book. More than a reference: the author seeks to provide a conceptual framework for understanding R’s structure and guide readers through R’s idiosyncratic mechanisms pointing out traps, illuminating difficult concepts and providing expert commentary.</p>

Professor Matloff’s interest in teaching the mechanics of programming infused with his deep understanding of both the underlying computer science and statistical theory put this book on top.</p>
<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028574.do" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028574.do', 'Hands on Programming with R']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank" style="cursor: url(chrome-extension://ledmjlnkdlappilhaaihfhanlpdjjalm/rockhand.png), auto;">Hands on Programming with R</a> by Garrett Grolemund – If you are not only new to R but new to programming as well this is the book for you.

A really nice feature of the book is its emphasis on presenting the R ecosystem along with core R concepts. When learning anything new, it is always helpful to understand the big picture. Keep this book by your computer, when you stop referring to it you will be a pretty good R programmer.</p>
<h3>Data Science with R</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461468486" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461468486', 'Applied Predictive Modeling']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank">Applied Predictive Modeling</a> by Max-Kuhn and Kjell Johnson – This book is the master text for predictive analytics, carefully walking through several modeling examples and making expert use of the extensive machine learning tools in R’s caret package. I have described the book more fully <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/06/review-of-applied-predictive-modeling-by-kuhn-and-johnson.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/06/review-of-applied-predictive-modeling-by-kuhn-and-johnson.html', 'here']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441998897" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441998897', 'Data Mining with Rattle and R']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank" style="cursor: url(chrome-extension://ledmjlnkdlappilhaaihfhanlpdjjalm/rockhand.png), auto;">Data Mining with Rattle and R</a> by Graham Williams – This is the perfect first book for machine learning with R. The rattle GUI helps get across the machine learning concepts and also produces some pretty good R code to get your started.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Data-Science-in-R-A-Case-Studies-Approach-to-Computational-Reasoning-and/Nolan-Lang/9781482234817" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.crcpress.com/Data-Science-in-R-A-Case-Studies-Approach-to-Computational-Reasoning-and/Nolan-Lang/9781482234817', 'Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Data Science']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank" style="cursor: url(chrome-extension://ledmjlnkdlappilhaaihfhanlpdjjalm/rockhand.png), auto;">Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Data Science</a> by Deborah Nolan and Duncan Temple Lang. – My most recent acquisition, this book consists of 12, non-trivial case studies organized under three themes: Data Manipulation and modeling, Simulation Studies and Data and Web Technologies. All of the data sets are messy and the projects identify and develop the kind of skills required to undertake open-ended data science projects. The book doesn’t teach R programming, but it shows why R is the appropriate language for doing data science.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r', 'Practical Data Science with R']);" ref="nofollow" target="_blank">Practical Data Science with R</a> by Nina Zumel and John Mount – This book is one of a kind. It moves fluidly between the various stages of the data science process from surface considerations of working with customers to the deep details of various machine learning algorithms. There is quite a bit of original R code that you can use in real projects. Most impressive is the statistical sensibility of the authors who want you to make correct inferences from your data and machine learning models as well as effectively&nbsp;&nbsp; communicate your findings to the people paying the bills.</p>
